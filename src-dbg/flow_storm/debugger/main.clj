(ns flow-storm.debugger.main

  " This is the main namespace for the debugger itself, the graphical part of FlowStorm,
  being `start-debugger` the main entry point.

  The debugger system is made of varios stateful components orchestrated by a custom state system
  defined `flow-storm.state-management`, which is similar to `mount`.

  We are choosing a custom state system so we depend on as less libraries as we can
  to avoid version conflicts with users libraries.

  The debugger will start a different set of components depending if we are running a
  remote or local debugger.
  The debugger is a local debugger when it runs in the same process as the debuggee and can call
  all functions locally in contrast with remote debugging like when connecting to a ClojureScript system
  or a remote Clojure system where calls had to be made via websocket and repl connections.

  Look at each component namespace doc string for more details on them.

  `:runtime-host` should be the ip of the debuggee (defaults to localhost)
  `:debugger-host` shoud be the ip where the debugger is running, since the debuggee needs to connect back to it (defaults to localhost)"
