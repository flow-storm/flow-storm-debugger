_FlowStorm_ is a tracing debugger for Clojure and ClojureScript.

It can instrument any Clojure code and provides many tools to explore and analyze your programs executions.

== Quick start

Before you start check _FlowStorm_ minimum requirements.

[IMPORTANT]
.Minimum requirements
====
	- jdk >= 17 (if you still need to run it with jdk11 take a look at <<#_run_with_jdk_11,here>>)
	- Clojure >= 1.10.0
====

=== Clojure

There are two ways of using _FlowStorm_ for Clojure :

	- With <<#_clojurestorm,ClojureStorm>> (recommended) : Swap your dev Clojure compiler by ClojureStorm and get everything instrumented automatically
	- <<#_vanilla_flowstorm,Vanilla FlowStorm>> : Just add FlowStorm to your dev classpath and instrument by tagging and re-evaluating forms
    
_ClojureStorm_ is a fork of the official Clojure compiler that adds automatic instrumentation so you don't need to think about it (you can still disable it when you don't need it).

You use it by swapping the official Clojure compiler by _ClojureStorm_ at dev time, using dev aliases or profiles.

==== ClojureStorm

This is the newest and simplest way of using _FlowStorm_. It requires you to swap your official Clojure compiler by _ClojureStorm_ only at dev time.

Swapping compilers sounds like a lot, but don't worry, _ClojureStorm_ is just a patch applied over the official compiler with some
extra stuff for automatic instrumentation, you shouldn't encounter any differences, it is only for dev, and you can swap it back and forth by starting
your repl with a different alias or lein profile.

The easiest way to run and learn _FlowStorm_ with _ClojureStorm_ is by running the repl tutorial, like this :

[,bash]
----
;; on linux and mac-os
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {} :aliases {:dev {:classpath-overrides {org.clojure/clojure nil} :extra-deps {com.github.flow-storm/clojure {:mvn/version "RELEASE"} com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}} :jvm-opts ["-Dclojure.storm.instrumentEnable=true" "-Dclojure.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=user"]}}}' -A:dev

;; on windows
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {} :aliases {:dev {:classpath-overrides {org.clojure/clojure nil} :extra-deps {com.github.flow-storm/clojure {:mvn/version """RELEASE"""} com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version """RELEASE"""}} :jvm-opts ["""-Dclojure.storm.instrumentEnable=true""" """-Dclojure.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=user"""]}}}' -A:dev
----

[IMPORTANT]
.On using maven RELEASE as version
====
Be careful when using RELEASE as maven versions, since the first time is going to fetch the latest one
but it will be cached unless you run with -Sforce.
It is much safer to just write the latest versions. Check out  the https://github.com/flow-storm/flow-storm-debugger/[github page] for the latest stable releases.
====

Pasting that command on your terminal will bring up a repl with _FlowStorm_ and the compiler swapped by _ClojureStorm_. When the repl comes up just
evaluate the `:tut/basics` keyword on it for a tour of the basics.

After the tutorial you would want to add and configure it for your projects, so here are the basics :

If your project is using deps.edn, your deps.edn file should look like this :
[,clojure]
----
{:paths ["src"]
 :deps {}
 :aliases {:dev {:classpath-overrides {org.clojure/clojure nil} ;; for disabling the official compiler
                 :extra-deps {com.github.flow-storm/clojure {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}
                              com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
                 :jvm-opts ["-Dclojure.storm.instrumentEnable=true"
                            "-Dclojure.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_STRING"]}}}
----

where `YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_STRING` should be a comma separated list of namespaces prefixes like :

	  my-project.,lib1.,lib2.core

which means only instrument my-project.* (which includes all sub namespaces), all lib1.* and only everything under lib2.core

This is probably what most people want since you don't want to instrument things like nrepl, cider or any of your tooling stuff
although you can still do it if you need it. There are also other options you can check with `:help`.

If your project uses lein, your project.clj file should look something like this :

[,clojure]
----
(defproject my.project "1.0.0"
  :profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[com.github.flow-storm/clojure "RELEASE"]
                                  [com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg "RELEASE"] ]
                   :exclusions [org.clojure/clojure] ;; for disabling the official compiler
                   :jvm-opts ["-Dclojure.storm.instrumentEnable=true"
                              "-Dclojure.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_STRING"]}}
  :main foo.core)
----

with `YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_STRING` as described above.

[NOTE]
.lein dependencies
====
Make sure your global :dependencies don't include the official org.clojure/clojure dependency.
For some reason lein will add the dependency to the classpath even if you have it on exclusions.
====

[NOTE]
.#rtrace and #trace
====
When using _FlowStorm_ with _ClojureStorm_ it is a error to use #trace or #rtrace. They aren't needed since
everything you declared in `clojure.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes` will be automatically instrumented.
====


==== Vanilla FlowStorm

If you use https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli[clojure cli] you can start a repl with the _FlowStorm_ dependency loaded like this :

[,bash]
----
;; on linux and mac-os
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}'

;; on windows
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version """RELEASE"""}}}'
----

[IMPORTANT]
.On using maven RELEASE as version
====
Be careful when using RELEASE as maven versions, since the first time is going to fetch the latest one
but it will be cached unless you run with -Sforce.
It is much safer to just write the latest versions. Check out  the https://github.com/flow-storm/flow-storm-debugger/[github page] for the latest stable releases.
====

If you are a https://leiningen.org/[lein] user add the dependency to your project.clj `:dependencies` and run `lein repl`.

Then require the api namespace and start the debugger :

[,clojure]
----
user> (require '[flow-storm.api :as fs-api]) ;; the only namespace you need to require

user> (fs-api/local-connect) ;; will run the debugger GUI and get everything ready
----

You should now see a empty debugger window.

Lets debug something :

[,clojure]
----
user> #rtrace (reduce + (map inc (range 10))) ;; #rtrace will instrument and run some code
----

image::user_guide_images/quick_start.png[]

After running it, you should get the return value of the expression (as if #rtrace wasn't there).
The debugger thread list (the one on the left) shows all the threads it has recordings for.
Double clicking on it should open the "thread exploring tools" for that thread in a new tab.

This guide will cover all the tools in more detail but if you are interested in code stepping for example
you will find it in the `code stepping tool` at the bottom left corner of the thread tab, the one that has the `()` icon.
Clicking on it will show you something like the picture above.

Go ahead and use the stepping controls to step over the code.

Now that everything seems to be working move on and explore the many features _FlowStorm_ provides. There are many ways of instrumenting
your code, and many ways to explore its executions.
	
=== ClojureScript

Debugging ClojureScript is a case of remote debugging in _FlowStorm_. This means the debugger
will run in a separate process and connect to the debuggee (your browser or nodejs runtime) via a websocket and optionally
an nrepl server.

There are two ways of using _FlowStorm_ with ClojureScript :

    - With <<#_clojurescriptstorm_with_shadow_cljs,ClojureScriptStorm>> (recommended) : Swap your ClojureScript compiler by ClojureScriptStorm at dev and get everything instrumented automatically
	- <<#_clojurescript_vanilla_flowstorm,Vanilla FlowStorm>> : Just add FlowStorm to your dev classpath and instrument by tagging and re-evaluating forms
    
_ClojureScriptStorm_ is a fork of the official ClojureScript compiler that adds automatic instrumentation so you don't need to think about it (you can still disable it when you don't need it).

You use it by swapping the official ClojureScript compiler by _ClojureScriptStorm_ at dev time, using dev aliases or profiles.

[NOTE]
.Repl connection
====
For enabling every debugger feature, _FlowStorm_ needs to connect to a cljs repl.
Currently only shadow-cljs repl over nrepl is supported.
====

==== ClojureScriptStorm with shadow-cljs

[IMPORTANT]
.Minimum requirements
====
    - Shadow Cljs >= 2.25.4
    - FlowStorm >= 3.7.4
====

For setting up _FlowStorm_ with shadow-cljs you need to modify two files, your `shadow-cljs.edn` and your `deps.edn`.
This is setup once and forget, so once you have configured _FlowStorm_ you can do everything from the UI, without
any other sources modifications.

If you want a shadow-cljs template to play with, take a look at https://github.com/jpmonettas/shadow-flow-storm-basic/[this repo].

[NOTE]
.shadow-cljs
====
Currently you can only use _ClojureScriptStorm_ with shadow-cljs if you are resolving your
dependencies with deps.edn. This means having `:deps true` or similar in your shadow-cljs.edn.
If you have your dependecies directly in your shadow-cljs.edn you will have to use <<#_clojurescript_vanilla_flowstorm,Vanilla FlowStorm>>
for now.
This is because there is currently no way to swap the ClojureScript compiler in shadow-cljs.edn.
====

First, make your shadow-cljs.edn looks something like this :

[,clojure]
----
{:deps {:aliases [:dev]}
 :nrepl {:port 9000}
 ... 
 :builds
 {:my-app {...
           :devtools {:preloads [flow-storm.storm-preload]
                      :http-port 8021}}}}
----

So, the important parts are: you need to tell shadow to apply your deps.edn dev alias, set up a nrepl port,
and also add `flow-storm.storm-preload` to your preloads. If you have other preloads make sure `flow-storm.storm-preload`
is the first one.

Then, modify your `deps.edn` dev profile to look like this :

[,clojure]
----
{...
 :aliases
 {:dev {:classpath-overrides {org.clojure/clojurescript nil} ;; disable the official compiler
        :extra-deps {thheller/shadow-cljs {:mvn/version "2.25.6" ;; >= 2.25.4
                                           :exclusions [org.clojure/clojurescript]}
                     ;; bring ClojureScriptStorm
                     com.github.flow-storm/clojurescript {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}
                     ;; add FlowStorm runtime dep
                     com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-inst {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
       :jvm-opts ["-Dcljs.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=your-app-base-ns"
                   "-Dcljs.storm.instrumentEnable=true"
                   "-Dflowstorm.startRecording=false"]}}}
----

There are lots of things going on there, but the main ones are: disabling the official compiler, adding
_ClojureScriptStorm_ and _FlowStorm_ dependencies, and then configuring what you want _ClojureScriptStorm_ to automatically
instrument.

It is important to configure what namespaces you want to instrument, and you do this by setting the
`cljs.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes` jvm property.

This is a comma separated list of namespaces prefixes, you normally want your app namespaces plus some libraries, like :
`cljs.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=org.my-app,org.my-lib,hiccup`

And this is it. Once you have it configured, run your shadow watch as you normally do, load your app on the browser (or nodejs).

Whenever your need the debugger, on a terminal run the ui with your shadow-cljs.edn data :

[,bash]
----
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -X flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger :port 9000 :repl-type :shadow :build-id :my-app
----

and then reload you page so it connects to it.

Since we started the app with `flowstorm.startRecording=false` you will have to click on the record button once to start recording.
Whenever recording is enable and something executes under an instrumented namespace you should see the recordings appear in the debugger
under the main thread.

[NOTE]
.recording expressions typed on the repl
====
If you type at the repl something like `(defn foo [a b] (+ a b))` under an instrumented ns, the `foo` funciton will get instrumented
automatically and you will able to explore the recordings after the function is called.
On the other side, typing a simple expression like `(+ 1 2)` will not show anything, this is currently a limitation but you can
still make that work by wrapping the expression on a fn and immediately calling it, like `((fn [] (+ 1 2)))`
====

==== ClojureScriptStorm with cljs.main

You can use _FlowStorm_ and _ClojureScriptStorm_ with cljs.main.

To compile instrumented files :

[,bash]
----
clj -J-Dcljs.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=org.foo -J-Dcljs.storm.instrumentEnable=true -Sdeps '{:paths ["src"] :deps {com.github.flow-storm/clojurescript {:mvn/version "RELEASE"} com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-inst {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -M -m cljs.main -co '{:preloads [flow-storm.storm-preload] :main org.foo.core}' --compile
----

To run a repl that instrument everything under org.foo :

[,bash]
----
clj -J-Dcljs.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=org.foo -J-Dcljs.storm.instrumentEnable=true -Sdeps '{:paths ["src"] :deps {com.github.flow-storm/clojurescript {:mvn/version "RELEASE"} com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-inst {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -M -m cljs.main -co '{:preloads [flow-storm.storm-preload] :main org.foo.core}' --repl
----

Then run the _FlowStorm_ UI :

[,bash]
----
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -X flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger
----

And now refresh your browser page so your browser app connects to the UI.

==== ClojureScript vanilla FlowStorm

Lets say you are using https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs[shadow-cljs] to start a ClojureScript repl.

First you need to add _FlowStorm_ dependency to your project dependencies, like this :

[,clojure]
----
$ cat shadow-cljs.edn

{...
 :dependencies [... [com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-inst "RELEASE"]]

 ;; the next two lines aren't needed but pretty convenient
 :nrepl {:port 9000}
 :my-build-id {:devtools {:preloads [flow-storm.preload]}}
 ...} 
----

[IMPORTANT]
.On using maven RELEASE as version
====
Be careful when using RELEASE as maven versions, since the first time is going to fetch the latest one
but it will be cached unless you run with -Sforce.
It is much safer to just write the latest versions. Check out  the https://github.com/flow-storm/flow-storm-debugger/[github page] for the latest stable releases.
====


Then lets say you start your repl like :

[,bash]
----
npx shadow-cljs watch :my-build-id

shadow-cljs - config: /home/jmonetta/demo/shadow-cljs.edn
shadow-cljs - server version: 2.19.0 running at http://localhost:9630
shadow-cljs - nREPL server started on port 9000
shadow-cljs - watching build :my-build-id
[:my-build-id] Configuring build.
[:my-build-id] Compiling ...
[:my-build-id] Build completed. (127 files, 0 compiled, 0 warnings, 6.19s)

cljs.user=> 
----

As you can see from the output log shadow-cljs started a nrepl server on port 9000, this is the port _FlowStorm_ needs to connect to,
so to start the debugger and connect to it you run :

[,bash]
----
;; on linux and mac-os
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -X flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger :port 9000 :repl-type :shadow :build-id :my-build-id

;; on windows
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version """RELEASE"""}}}' -X flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger :port 9000 :repl-type :shadow :build-id :my-build-id
----

And that is all you need, the debugger GUI will pop up and everything will be ready.

Try tracing some code from the repl :

[,clojure]
----
cljs.user> #rtrace (reduce + (map inc (range 10))) ;; #rtrace will instrument and run some code
----

After running it, you should get the return value of the expression (as if #rtrace wasn't there).

The debugger thread list (the one on the left) shows all the threads it has recordings for. Because we are
in javascript land there will always be just one thread, called `main`.
Double clicking it should open the "thread exploring tools" for that thread in a new tab.

This guide will cover all the tools in more detail but if you are interested in code stepping for example you will find
it in the `code stepping tool` at the bottom left corner of the thread tab, the one that has the `()` icon.

Click on it and use the stepping controls to step over the code.

Now that everything seems to be working move on and explore the many features _FlowStorm_ provides. There are many ways of instrumenting
your code, and many ways to explore its executions.

If you are not using a repl or the repl you are using isn't supported by _FlowStorm_ yet you can still use the debugger
but not all features will be supported (mainly the browser features).

For this you can start the debugger like before but without any parameters, like this :

[,bash]
----
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -X flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger
----

And then go to your app code and call `(flow-storm.runtime.debuggers-api/remote-connect)` maybe on your main, so every time your program starts
will automatically connect to the repl.

[NOTE]
.ClojureScript environments
====

_FlowStorm_ is supported for ClojureScript in :

		  - Browsers
		  - NodeJS
		  - React native
====

[NOTE]
.NodeJs and react-native
====
On NodeJs and react-native you need to install the `websocket` library.
Do this by running `npm install websocket --save`

For react-native if your app is running inside a cellphone you will have to also provide the `:debugger-host` key
to `flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger` with your box ip address, unless you are using adb reverse with your ports for
which you will have to `adb reverse tcp:7722 tcp:7722` (the debugger websocket port)
====

[NOTE]
.App initialization debugging
====
If you need to debug some app initialization, for adding `#trace` tags before the debugger is connected you
will have to require flow-storm.api yourself, probably in your main. All the tracing will be replayed to the debugger
once it is connected.
====

Here is a repo you can use if you want to try _FlowStorm_ with shadow-cljs https://github.com/flow-storm/shadow-flow-storm-basic

==== Multiple ClojureScript builds

You can setup FlowStorm to debug multiple ClojureScript builds. This can be useful when your application is made up of multiple parts,
like when you have web workers.

Debugging multiple builds require multiple debugger instances, one per build.

The FlowStorm UI will start a websocket server, by default on 7722, so if you want to run multiple instances of it, you need
to run each instance under a different port. You can do this by providing a `:ws-port` to the startup command.

So let's say you want to run two debuggers, one for your page and one for a webworker, your can run them like this :

[,bash]
----
# on one terminal start your app debugger instance
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -X flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger :port 9000 :repl-type :shadow :build-id :my-app :ws-port 7722

# on a second terminal start your webworker debugger instance
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -X flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger :port 9000 :repl-type :shadow :build-id :my-web-worker :ws-port 7733
----

Now you also need to configure your builds to tell them what port they should connect to.
You do this by writing different preloads for each of your builds, and then using them instead of your `flow-storm.storm-preload`, like:

`my_app.main_storm_preload.cljs`

[,clojure]
----
(ns my-app.main-storm-preload
  (:require [cljs.storm.tracer]
            [flow-storm.tracer :as tracer]
            [flow-storm.runtime.debuggers-api :as dbg-api]))

(tracer/hook-clojurescript-storm)
(dbg-api/setup-runtime)
(dbg-api/remote-connect {:debugger-ws-host "localhost" :debugger-ws-port 7722})
----

`my_app.webworker_storm_preload.cljs`

[,clojure]
----
(ns my-app.webworker-storm-preload
  (:require [cljs.storm.tracer]
            [flow-storm.tracer :as tracer]
            [flow-storm.runtime.debuggers-api :as dbg-api]))

(tracer/hook-clojurescript-storm)
(dbg-api/setup-runtime)
(dbg-api/remote-connect {:debugger-ws-host "localhost" :debugger-ws-port 7733})
----

They are the same as `flow-storm.storm-preload` just with different port numbers.

Now you can configure your shadow-cljs.edn like this :
[,clojure]
----
{...
 :builds
 {:app
  {:target :browser
   ...
   :modules
   {:my-app {:init-fn my.app/init
           :preloads [my-app.main-storm-preload]}
    :my-webworker {:init-fn my.app.worker/init
                   :preloads [my-app.webworker-storm-preload]
                   :web-worker true}}}}}
----

[NOTE]
.Multiple debuggers tips
====
You can change the theme or customize the styles of different instances to make it easier to
know which debugger instance is connected to which application.
====

=== Babashka

You can debug your babashka scripts with FlowStorm using the JVM. The process is quite simple.

Let's say we want to debug this example script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babashka/babashka/master/examples/htmx_todoapp.clj
which runs a webserver with a basic todo app.

First we need to generate a deps.edn by running `bb print-deps > deps.edn`

Then modify the resulting deps.edn to add the FlowStorm alias like this :

[,clojure]
----
{...
 :aliases {:dev {:classpath-overrides {org.clojure/clojure nil} ;; for disabling the official compiler
                 :extra-deps {com.github.flow-storm/clojure {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}
                              com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
                 :jvm-opts ["-Dclojure.storm.instrumentEnable=true"
                            "-Dclojure.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=user"]}}}
----

With `clojure.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=user` we are telling ClojureStorm to instrument everything inside
the `user` namespace since the script doesn't contain any namespace declaration.

And that is it, you can now start your clojure repl as usual, with `clj -A:dev` and then eval the `:dbg` keyword to
start the debugger UI.

Then eval the entire file to compile everything.To start the server in this example you will have to remove the wrapping
that is basically only allowing the server to run if we are running from babashka, like this :

[,clojure]
----
(when true #_(= *file* (System/getProperty "babashka.file"))
  ...)
----

so we can also start it from Clojure.

After the server has started, you can use the app from the browser and everything will get recorded as usual.

== Remote debugging

You can remotely debug any Clojure application the exposes a nrepl server.

In terms of dependencies, the debuggee side should be setup the same as a normal local setup, with the optional change that you can use
`flow-storm-inst` instead of `flow-storm-dbg`, being the former a slimmed down version of the later one that
doesn't contain some libraries used only by the UI, but using the full `flow-storm-dbg` is also ok.

The easiest way to debug a remote application is via a ssh tunnel. You can create it from your dev box like this :

[,bash]
----
ssh -L 9000:localhost:9000 -R 7722:localhost:7722 my-debuggee-box.com
----

assuming your remote process at my-debuggee-box.com has started a nrepl server listening on port 9000 and 
that the debugger websocket server is running on the default port.

After the tunnel is established, you can run you debugger UI like this :

[,bash]
----
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -X flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger :port 9000
----

and that is it.

If you need to connect the debugger to a remote process without a ssh tunnel or you need to configure the websocket server port you can do it like this :

[,bash]
----
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -X flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger :port NREPL-PORT :runtime-host '"YOUR-APP-BOX-IP-ADDRESS"' :debugger-host '"YOUR-BOX-IP-ADDRESS"' :ws-port WS-SERVER-PORT
----

=== Docker

If you run you process inside a docker container, here is a basic template for using _FlowStorm_ with it
https://github.com/flow-storm/docker-flow-storm-basic

== Instrument code

[NOTE]
.ClojureStorm
====
Instructions here only apply to vanilla _FlowStorm_ and ClojureScript debugging. If you are using _ClojureStorm_
this is done automatically for you, so just skip this section.
====

Code instrumentation in _FlowStorm_ is done by rewriting your code, in a way that doesn't change its behavior
but when executed will trace everything the code is doing.

You can instrument code from the <<#_browser_tool,browser tool>> or the repl.

=== Instrument from the repl

==== Instrument any form with #trace

You can instrument any top level form at the repl by writing `#trace` before it, like this :

[,clojure]
----
#trace
(defn sum [a b]
  (+ a b))
----

and then evaluating the form.

important:: `#trace` is meant to be used with forms that don't run immediately, like: defn, defmethod, extend-type, etc.
Use `#rtrace` to trace and run a form, like `#rtrace (map inc (range 10))`.

==== Run code with #rtrace

`#rtrace` is useful in two situations :

First, when instrumenting and running a simple form at the repl, like:

[,clojure]
----
#rtrace (-> (range) (filter odd?) (take 10) (reduce +))
----

Second, when you want to run a form with a certain flow id (see <<#_flows_tool,flows>>).

`#rtrace` by default will instrument and run the form with flow id 0, but you can use
`#rtrace0`, `#rtrace1`, `#rtrace2`, `#rtrace3`, `#rtrace4`, `#rtrace5` to trace with flows ids [0..5].

==== Instrument namespaces

_FlowStorm_ allows you to instrument entire namespaces by providing `flow-storm.api/instrument-namespaces-clj`.

You call it like this :

[,clojure]
----
(instrument-namespaces-clj #{"org.my-app.core" "cljs."})
----

The first argument is a set of namespaces prefixes to instrument. In the previous example it means
instrument all namespaces starting with `org.my-app.core`, and all starting with `cljs.`

The second argument can be a map supporting the following options :

- `:excluding-ns` a set of strings with namespaces that should be excluded
- `:disable` a set containing any of #{`:expr` `:binding` `:anonymous-fn`} useful for disabling unnecessary traces in code that generate too many
- `:verbose?` when true show more logging

==== What can't be instrumented?

This are some limitations when instrumenting forms :

1. Very big forms can't be fully instrumented. The JVM spec has a limit on the size of methods and instrumentation adds a lot of code.
When instrumenting entire namespaces, if you hit this limit on a form a warning will printed on the console saying `Instrumented expression is too large for the Clojure compiler`
and _FlowStorm_ automatically tries to instrument it with a lighter profile, by disabling some instrumentation.

2. Functions that call recur without a loop

3. Functions that return recursive lazy sequences. Like `(fn foo [] (lazy-seq (... (foo))))`

==== Un-instrument code

Un-instrumenting code that has been instrumented with `#trace` or `#ctrace` is straight forward, just remove the tag and re evaluate the form.

To un-instrument entire namespaces you can use `flow-storm.api/uninstrument-namespaces-clj` which accept a set of namespaces prefixes.

=== Instrument with the browser

Most of the time you can instrument code by just clicking in the browser. The only exceptions are functions that were just defined in the repl
and weren't loaded from a file. 

==== Instrument vars

Using the browser you can navigate to the var you are interested in and then use the instrument button to instrument it.

image::user_guide_images/browser_var_instrumentation.png[]

There are two ways of instrumenting a var :

- Instrument (instrument just the var source code)
- Instrument recursively (recursively instrument the var and all vars referred by it)

==== Instrument namespaces

Using the browser you can also instrument multiple namespaces. Do this by selecting the namespaces you are interested in
and then a right click should show you a menu with two instrumentation commands.

image::user_guide_images/browser_ns_instrumentation.png[]

- `Instrument namespace :light` - record function arguments and return values (not expressions, no bindings tracing)

- `Instrument namespace :full` fully instrument everything

Light instrumentation is useful when you know the functions generate too many traces, so you can opt to trace just functions
calls and returns. You can then <<#_fully_instrument_a_form_from_the_code_view, fully instrument>> whatever functions you are interested in.

==== Un-instrument code

The bottom panel shows all instrumented vars and namespaces.

image::user_guide_images/browser_uninstrument.png[]

You can un-instrument them temporarily with the enable/disable checkbox or
permanently with the del button.

=== Fully instrument a form from the code view

image::user_guide_images/fully_instrument_form.png[]

If you have instrumented a form with the <<#_instrument_namespaces_2, :light profile>> you can fully instrument it by right clicking on the current form
and then clicking `Fully instrument this form`.

== Flows tool

The `Flows` tab contains a bunch of tools for analyzing all traced executions flows.

Flows are identified by a flow-id and can be started by running a form with `#rtrace`, `#rtrace1`, `#rtrace2`, etc,.
If you run a flow twice with the same flow id, the first one is going to be replaced.

A flow will happen in one or more threads. A separate tab will show for each thread.

For example if we trace a form that spawns multiple threads :

[,clojure]
----
#rtrace (-> (pmap (fn [i] (* i i)) (range 5)))
----

image::user_guide_images/thread_outer_form.png[]

the `(-> (pmap ... (range 5)))` form will run on the `main` thread

image::user_guide_images/thread_inner_form.png[]

while the `(fn [i] (* i i))`. executions will be distributed in the `clojure-agent-send-off-pool-*` since `clojure.core/pmap` is backed by a thread pool.

Anything instrumented that isn't run under #rtrace will end up in the funnel flow, which accumulates all traces that don't contain any flow-id.

image::user_guide_images/funnel_flow.png[]

=== Code tool

image::user_guide_images/code_tool_tab.png[]

The code tool is the second of the `Flows` tab. It provides most of the functionality found in a traditional debugger.
You can use it to step over each expression, visualize values, locals and more.

==== Code stepping

image::user_guide_images/controls.png[]

The code tool allows you to step and "travel thought time" in two ways:

- You can use the controls at the top to step over your code in different ways.

- Or you can click on the highlighted forms to position the debugger at that point in time.

Only the forms that were executed at least once for the flow and thread will be highlighted.

From left to right this are the controls you have available :

- Jump to the first step of the recording.
- Step over backwards, will make one step backwards always staying on the same frame.
- Step backwards, will step backwards in time going into sub functions.
- Step out, will position the debugger in the next step after this function was called.
- Re run flow. This allows you to re-run the entire flow if it is different from the funnel flow. Only useful in vanilla FlowStorm.
- Step forward, will step forward in time going into sub functions.
- Step over forward, will make one step forwards always staying on the same frame.
- Jump to the last step of the recording.

The numbers at the center show `current_step_index / total_steps`. This means that a total of `total_steps` has been recorded
for this thread so far. The buttons right next to it control undo/redo of the navigation system and the <<#_bookmarks, bookmarking system>>.

Write any number (less than total_steps) on the text box to jump into that position in time.

==== Power stepping

The controls at the right are power stepping controls. They provide more powerfull ways of stepping through the code.

There are currently 3 power stepping tools :

- identity, will step to the next value which identity is the same as the current value
- equality, will step to the next value which is equals (clojure equality) to the current value
- custom, allows you to provide a predicate, which will be used to find the next step.
  If you define it like `(fn [v] (map? v))` will make the power stepper step over all map values.

image::user_guide_images/controls_power_custom.png[]

Clicking on the back and forward button will use the selected power stepping tool.

[NOTE]
.Custom stepping
====
Custom power stepping is only supported in Clojure now.
====


==== Searching

You can use the search box under the controls to search for the next expression (starting at your current step) which it's string
serialization contains your search text.

You can use the print-level and print-length fields to control how deep this serialization will be made. If this numbers are big
and you are searching over lots of nested data it will take some time. The search progress will be displayed at the right
and you can always use Ctrl-g to stop the search if it is taking too long.

==== Loops

When clicking on a highlighted form two things can happen :

	 - If the form was executed only once for the current frame, the debugger will immediately jump to it.
	 - Else if the form was executed multiple times, a context menu will show all the values that form evaluated to, sorted by time,
	 and clicking on them will make the debugger jump to that specific point in time. This is useful for debugging loops.

image::user_guide_images/loops.png[]

==== Exception debugging

If you are using _ClojureStorm_ you can jump to the last captured exception by evaluating the `:ex` keyword on your repl. This
will position the debugger right before the exception so you can step backwards and explore the cause.

If you are using vanilla or using _FlowStorm_ with ClojureScript, most of the time you can accomplish the same by clicking the `Step last` button
right after the exception happens.

==== Locals

The locals panel will always show the locals bounded for the current point in time.

image::user_guide_images/locals.png[]

Right clicking on them will show a menu where you can :

	  - define all frame vars 
	  - define the value with a name, so you can use it at the repl
	  - inspect the value with the <<#_value_inspector,value inspector>>
	  - tap the value as with `tap>`

`Define all frame vars` will define all the bindings for the entire frame in the current form namespace.
This is useful for trying things at your editor as described here https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2017/6/5/repl-debugging-no-stacktrace-required

==== Stack

The stack panel will always show the current stacktrace. Be aware that the stacktrace
only include functions calls that had been recorded, so if you aren't recording everything
there will be gaps.

image::user_guide_images/stack.png[]

Double clicking on any of the stack entries will make the debugger jump to that point in time.

==== Value panels

Value panels show in many places in _FlowStorm_.

image::user_guide_images/value_panels.png[]

The value panel in the code tool always display a pretty print of the current expression value.

You can configure the print-level and print-meta for the pretty printing by using the controls at the top.

===== Define value for repl

Use the `def` button to define a var pointing to the current inspector value.

You can use / to provide a namespace, otherwise will be defined under [cljs.]user

==== Bookmarks

Bookmarks are useful when you find yourself jumping around, trying to understand a complex execution. They enable
you to mark execution positions so you can come back to them later.

image::user_guide_images/bookmarks_controls.png[]

You can bookmark the current position by pressing the bookmark button on the left. It will ask you the bookmark description.

Use the button on the right to open the bookmarks panel.

image::user_guide_images/bookmarks.png[]

Double clicking on any bookmark will make the debugger jump back to it's position.

==== Re running a flow

Every time you run a form with #rtrace _FlowStorm_ keeps a copy of the form. You can use the re-run-flow button after instrumenting or un-instrumenting code,
since it allows you to re run the form with a single click.

=== Call Stack tree tool

The call stack tree tool is the first one of the `Flows` tab. It allows you to see the execution flow by expanding its call stack tree.

image::user_guide_images/callstack_tool_tab.png[]

The call stack tree is useful for a high level overview of a complex execution and also as a tool for quickly moving through time.

You can jump to any point in time by double clicking on a node or by right clicking and on the context menu selecting `Step code`. 

image::user_guide_images/callstack_tree.png[]

[NOTE]
.Tree refreshing
====
If _FlowStorm_ keeps receiving traces for the thread you are analyzing, it will keep building the tree but will not automatically refresh its visuals.
You can use the refresh button at the root to update it.
====

Use the button at the top left corner of the tree tool to show the current frame of the debugger in the tree.

There are also two <<#_value_panels,value panels>> at the bottom that show the arguments and return value for the currently selected function call.

=== Functions tool

The functions tool is the third one of the `Flows` tab.

image::user_guide_images/functions_tool_tab.png[]

It shows a list of all traced functions sort by how many times the have been called.

image::user_guide_images/functions.png[]

Normal functions will be colored black, multimethods magenta and types/records protocols/interfaces implementations in green.

Together with the <<#_call_stack_tree_tool, call stack tree>> provide a high level overview of a flow thread execution and allows you to
jump through time much quicker than single stepping.

You can search over the functions list by using the bar at the top.

==== Function calls

Double clicking on any function will display all function calls on the right sorted by time. Each line will show the arguments vector
for each call, and you can use the check boxes at the top to hide some of them.

image::user_guide_images/function_calls.png[]

Clicking on any item will display the result of the call in the value pane, while double clicking on any item in the functions call list will move the debugger to that specific point in time.

==== Un-instrumenting functions

Since the functions tool shows all the functions sorted by how many time they have been called it is a good tool to
see where most of your traces are coming from. If you want to reduce the number of traces, to make lets say, search faster,
you can right click on any function to un instrument it. You will have to <<#_re_running_a_flow,re run the flow>> after.

== Browser tool

The browser tool is pretty straight forward. It allows you to navigate your namespaces and vars, and also instrument/un-instrument them.

image::user_guide_images/browser.png[]

See <<#_instrument_with_the_browser, instrument with the browser>> for more info.

== Taps tool

Use the taps tool to visualize your `tap>`.

image::user_guide_images/taps.png[]

Everytime _FlowStorm_ starts, it will add a tap, so whenever you `tap>` something
it will show on the taps list.

Double click on any value to show it in the value inspector.

If the tapped value has also been recorded as an expression in Flows, you can right click on it
and run `Search value on Flows` to move the debugger to that point in time.

[NOTE]
.Search value on Flows
====
Be aware that if the code that taps your value is something like `(tap> :a-key)` you won't be able to jump
to it using this, because `:a-key` isn't a value recorded by _FlowStorm_, while if the tapping
code is like `(tap> some-bind)` or `(tap> (+ 2 3))` or the tapping of any other expression
you should be able to jump to it.
So if you want to use this functionality as a "mark" so you can quickly jump to different parts of
the recordings from the Taps tool, you can do it like `(tap> (str :my-mark))`
====

A `#tap` tag will also be available, which will tap and return so you can use it like `(+ 1 2 #tap (* 3 4))`
Use the `clear` button to clear the list.

There is also `#tap-stack-trace`. It will tap the current stack trace.

== Docs tool

Generate projects functions documentation by sampling their executions.

=== Generating docs

Lets say we want to generate documentation for datascript(https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/). 

First we clone the repo. Then we can generate it by calling `flow-storm.api/cli-doc`. 

For convenience we are going to create a script `document.sh` like this :

[,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-inst {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' \
    -X:test flow-storm.api/cli-doc \
    :result-name '"datascript-flow-docs-1.4.0"' \
    :print-unsampled? true \
    :instrument-ns '#{"datascript"}' \
    :fn-symb 'datascript.test/test-clj' \
    :fn-args '[]' \
    :examples-pprint? true \
    :examples-print-length 2 \
    :examples-print-level 3 
----

The idea behind `flow-storm.api/cli-doc` is to act as a trampoline, so it will instrument our code base as specified by `:instrument-ns` 
then call whatever function provided by `:fn-symb` and `:fn-args`.

For this case we are going to instrument every namespace that starts with "datascript" and then run `datascript.test/test-clj` without arguments.

For the rest of the options check `flow-storm.api/cli-doc` doc string.

It will output 3 useful things :

- datascript-flow-docs-1.4.0.jar containing just a sample.edn file with all the data
- the coverage percentage (how many fns were sampled over the instrumented ones)
- unsampled fns, which are all the functions that were instrumented but the test never called

So if you are running your tests, as a bonus you will get your test "coverage" and a list of functions your 
tests aren't exercising, you should see something like this after it finishes :

image::user_guide_images/flow_docs_cli.png[]

=== Publishing docs

Given the docs are already in jar format you can publish them to your local repo or any maven repo (like Clojars) 
with the usual mvn utilities.

=== Consuming docs

_FlowStorm_ debugger provides a way of visualizing whatever docs you have on your classpath.

For this you can add the docs and _FlowStorm_ to your classpaths as usual, like :

[,bash]
----
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"} dsdocs/dsdocs {:local/root "/home/user/datascript/datascript-flow-docs-1.4.0.jar"}}}'
----

or if you want to use the documentation I already generated and uploaded to my clojars group try :

[,bash]
----
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"} com.github.flow-storm/datascript-flow-docs {:mvn/version "1.4.0"}}}'
----

and now we can run the debugger :

[,clojure]
----
(require '[flow-storm.api :as fs-api])

(fs-api/local-connect)
----

The documentation will be available under the Docs tool.

You can search and click over all the functions you have loaded from all your imported docs to see the details.

Currently it shows fns meta, arguments, returns, and call examples.

image::user_guide_images/flow_docs_browser.png[]

=== TIPS

If you are using the emacs integration you can do `C-c C-f d` (flow-storm-show-current-var-doc) to show the current function documentation 
in the debugger.


== Timeline tool

You can use this tool to record, display and navigate a total order of your recordings in a timeline, in the order they executed.
This can be used, for example, to visualize how multiple threads expressions interleave, which is sometimes useful to debug race conditions.

By default recording this total ordering is disabled, but you can enable it just by clicking the `Enable` checkbox at the top, like this :

image::user_guide_images/timeline_enable.png[]

Once it is enable _FlowStorm_ will record everything as usual but also record the total order for your function calls and expressions,
which you can then retrieve and update by clicking on the refresh button at the top.

As an example, lets say you record this code :

[,clojure]
----
(pmap (fn my-sum [i] (+ i i)) (range 4))
----

after hitting refresh you should see something like this :

image::user_guide_images/timeline.png[]

As you can see the timeline tool displays a linear representation of your expressions. Times flows from top to bottom and
each thread gets assigned a different color. Every time a function is called or returns you will see it under the `Function`
column, and for each expression executed you will see a row with its `Expression` and `Value`.

Double clicking any row will take you to the `Flows tool` code at that point in time.

[NOTE]
.Big recordings timeline
====
Rendering the timeline needs some processing to render each sub-form and print each value so be aware it could be slow
if you try it on big recordings.
====

== Printer tool

_FlowStorm_ has a lot of functionality to replace printing to the console as a debugging method since most of the time it is pretty
inefficient. Nonetheless, some times adding a bunch of print lines to specific places in your code base is a very powerful way
of understanding your execution.

For this cases _FlowStorm_ has the `Printer tool`, which allows you to define, manage and visualize print points, without the need
of re running your code again. It will work on your recordings as everything else.

You can add and re run print points over your recordings as many times as you need. To add a print point, just right click on any
recorded expression. It will ask you for an optional message, which you can use to identify this particular prints in the output console.

image::user_guide_images/printer_add.png[]

After you add them, the `Print tool` will show all your prints. You can use the panel at the top to manage them.
Before printing anything you need to select the thread you would like to run the prints on. After selecting it, just click
the `refresh` button and everything will be re-printed.

image::user_guide_images/printer.png[]

You can tweak your prints at any time, like changing the print-length, print-level, message or just temporarily disable any of them.
When you are ok re-setting you prints, just click refresh and they will print again.

Double clicking on any printed line will jump to the Flows code tab, with the debugger pointed to the expression that generated the print.

[NOTE]
.Print messages
====
You can use `%s` in your print messages to place the printed representation of your value. If you provide a message without `%s` it will
be added after a space at the end.
====


== Value inspector

Use the value inspector to explore any data.

image::user_guide_images/value_inspector.png[]

Use it to lazily and recursively navigate your data. It will render collections with links you can use
to dig deeper into the data.

The top bar provides a way of navigating back.

- Use the `def` button to define the current value for the repl.
- Use the `tap` button to tap the current value.
- When inspecting any value from an execution flow, two more buttons will appear. They allow you to search
forward and backwards in the execution the current selected value.

[NOTE]
.Datafy
====
Value inspector uses `clojure.datafy/datafy` under the hood, so you can explore your objects also.
====

== Thread breakpoints

image::user_guide_images/thread_breaks.png[]

_FlowStorm_ is a tracing debugger, which means it can record what is happening without the need of stopping
your programs execution. This is all fine but doesn't cover every possible situation. There are
cases where recording everything is impractical, like in a game loop, since it will consume a lot of heap
and you are probably not interested in all those frames details.

For situations like the previous one, _FlowStorm_ has the ability to set thread breakpoints, which means to define points
in the execution of your program where you want your threads to wait.
While the threads are waiting you can explore what happened so far. If the recorded information isn't enough you can
click the play buttons next to each blocked thread to tell it to continue until it hit a breakpoint again, or right
click on any of the blocked threads and select `Unblock all threads` to unlock all of them.
Then you can analyse the new recordings. Once you are done, you can choose to uninstrument
your functions, or maybe easier to just pause recording using the pause button in the main toolbar. Then you
can remove the breakpoints and un-block every thread.

You can define thread breakpoints in two ways :

- Using the browser (like in the image below), you can navigate to any function and click on the `Break` button. This will block the calling
  thread every time the selected function gets called.
- Or you can also install a break by calling (flow-storm.api/break-at 'my-proj.core/some-fn)

image::user_guide_images/browser_breakpoints.png[]

[NOTE]
.Conditional threads breakpoints
====
The break-at fn accepts a second argument where you can provide a predicate that will be called with the same arguments
of the function you are breaking. It will only break when the predicate returns true. If you don't
provide a predicate it will default to `(constantly true)`
====

You can remove breakpoints by :

- Clicking on the browser instrumentation list delete buttons
- Calling `flow-storm.api/remove-break` to remove a single breakpoint
- Calling `flow-storm.api/clear-breaks` to remove all breakpoints

== Limiting recording

When recording an application execution (specially when using _ClojureStorm_ or _ClojureScriptStorm_) is common to find some
high frequency functions adding a lot of noise to your recordings. For example a mouse-move event processing will generate a lot of
recordings while you use your app.

Most of the time, having the recording paused and just enabling it right before executing the action you are interested in is enough, but
when it isn't, you can try functions call limiting.

There are a couple of ways to limit your functions calls by thread.

The first one is by adding the `flowstorm.threadFnCallLimits` JVM prop.

For example, you can add `"-Dflowstorm.threadFnCallLimits=org.my-app/fn1:2,org.my-app/fn2:4"` so every time the system starts, limits will be set for
`org.my-app/fn1` and `org.my-app/fn2`. The number next to them is the limit. When a function reaches the limit _FlowStorm_ will stop recording calls
to it and all the functions down its callstack.

You can also modify the limits from your repl, by calling `flow-storm.runtime.indexes.api/[add-fn-call-limit|rm-fn-call-limit|get-fn-call-limits]`.
In ClojureScript you need to call them via your cljs repl.

All limits are per thread, so when a thread recording is created it will start with the current defined counters, and each time a function gets called
the counter will decrement. When it reaches zero the function and all functions calls under it will stop being recorded.

When you clear your threads you are also crearing its limit counters, so next time you record something new counters will be initialized from your
global limits definitions.

== The tool bar

The toolbar provides quick access to some general commands :

image::user_guide_images/toolbar.png[]

From left to right :

- Clean all. Will clean all flows, taps and every value the debugger is retaining.
- Cancel current running task. If the debugger is taking too long with something and you want to cancel it use this button.
- Start/Stop recording. You can keep code instrumented but keep your heap from growing by stopping recording when you are not debugging.
- Unblock all breakpoint blocked threads if any.
- Quick jump. Use it for quickly jumping to the first recording of a function. Will autocomplete the first 25 matches.

== Debug cmd line programs (clj -X, clj -m, etc)

If you run any Clojure programs from the command line, by using `clj -X ...`, `clj -m ...` etc, 
you can use `flow-storm.api/cli-run` as a trampoline, to start a debugger, instrument everything you are interested in an then
run you original command.

As an example, lets say you are compiling ClojureScript code like this :

[,bash]
----
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.11.57"}}}' \
    -M -m cljs.main -t nodejs ./org/foo/myscript.cljs
----

you can then run and debug the execution of the same command like this :

[,bash]
----
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.11.57"} com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"} com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-inst {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' \
	-X flow-storm.api/cli-run :instrument-ns '#{"cljs."}'           \
                              :profile ':light'                     \
                              :require-before '#{"cljs.repl.node"}' \
							  :excluding-ns '#{"cljs.vendor.cognitect.transit"}' \
                              :fn-symb 'cljs.main/-main'            \
                              :fn-args '["-t" "nodejs" "./org/foo/myscript.cljs"]';
----

== Programmable debugging

_FlowStorm_ gives you full access to its internal indexes from the repl so you can write programs to analyze your traces if whats provided by the GUI is not
enough.

Lets say you have traced some code and now you want to analyze the traces from the repl, this are some examples :

[,clojure]
----
(require '[flow-storm.runtime.indexes.api :as index-api]) ;; first require the index-api

(index-api/print-threads)        ;; you can print all threads
(index-api/select-thread nil 16) ;; select the flow-id and thread-id, so you don't need to be constantly typing it
----

=== Example 1 

Collect all the types information for parameters that flow into a function

[,clojure]
----
(defn fn-signatures [fn-ns fn-name]
    (let [[flow-id thread-id] @index-api/selected-thread
          frames (index-api/all-frames flow-id thread-id (fn [fns fname _ _]
                                                           (and (= fn-name fname)
                                                                (= fn-ns fns))))
          signature-types (->> frames
                               (reduce (fn [coll-samples frame]
                                         (conj coll-samples (mapv type (:args-vec frame))))
                                       #{}))]
      signature-types))

=== Example 2

Visualization lenses over traces. Say I have a loop-recur process in which I am computing
new versions of an accumulated data structure, but I want to see only some derived data
instead of the entire data-structure (like, a visualization based on every frame of the loop).

Lets say we stepped with the debugger to index 109 (some expression inside a loop),
and we want to work with all the values for that coordinate from the repl, then you can :

[,clojure]
----
(defn frame-similar-values [idx]
    (let [[flow-id thread-id] @index-api/selected-thread
          {:keys [fn-call-idx coord]} (index-api/timeline-entry flow-id thread-id idx :at)
          {:keys [expr-executions]} (index-api/frame-data flow-id thread-id fn-call-idx {:include-exprs? true})]

      (->> expr-executions
           (reduce (fn [coll-vals expr-exec]
                     (if (= coord (:coord expr-exec))
                       (conj coll-vals (:result expr-exec))
                       coll-vals))
                   []))))
				   
(frame-similar-values 109) ;; get all the values
----

=== Example 3

Create a small stepper for the repl

[,clojure]
----
;; a helper for pprinting forms with highlighted parts
(require '[flow-storm.form-pprinter :as form-pprinter])
;; and some utils for printing with colors
(require '[flow-storm.utils :as utils]) 

(def idx (atom 0)) ;; the state of our debugger, where we are in the timeline

(defn show-current []
    (let [[flow-id thread-id] @index-api/selected-thread
          {:keys [type fn-ns fn-name coord fn-call-idx result] :as idx-entry} (index-api/timeline-entry flow-id thread-id @idx :at)
          {:keys [form-id]} (index-api/frame-data flow-id thread-id fn-call-idx {})
          {:keys [form/form]} (index-api/get-form form-id)]
      (case type
        :fn-call (let [{:keys [fn-name fn-ns]} idx-entry]
                   (println "Called" fn-ns fn-name))
        (:expr :fn-return) (let [{:keys [coord result]} idx-entry]
                             (form-pprinter/pprint-form-hl-coord form coord)
                             (println "\n")
                             (println "==[VAL]==>" (utils/colored-string result :yellow))))))

(defn step-next []
  (swap! idx inc)
  (show-current))

(defn step-prev []
  (swap! idx dec)
  (show-current))

;; use the debugger with
(reset! idx 12) ;; move the idx wherever you want
(step-next)
(step-prev)

== Dealing with mutable values

_FlowStorm_ will retain all values pointers when code executes so you can analyze them later. This works great with immutable values but
when your code uses mutable values like this :

[,clojure]
----
#rtrace
(let [a (java.util.ArrayList.)]
  (count a)
  (.add a "hello")
  (count a)
  (.add a "world")
  (.add a "!"))
----  

then every time you step over `a` it will contain the last value ["hello" "world" "!"].

You can fix this situation by extending the flow-storm.runtime.values/SnapshotP protocol like this :

[,clojure]
----
(extend-protocol flow-storm.runtime.values/SnapshotP
  java.util.ArrayList
  (snapshot-value [a] (into [] a)))
----

to provide _FlowStorm_ a way of creating a snapshot of the mutable value.

[NOTE]
.ClojureStorm
====
If you are using _ClojureStorm_ evaluate the previous defmethod in a ns that is not being
instrumented to avoid an infinite recursion.
====

Be aware that this is tricky in multithreading situations, as always with mutable values.

[NOTE]
.Atoms and derefable values
====
If the value implements clojure.lang.IDeref (or cljs.core.IDeref in Cljs) a snapshot will be created automatically by derefing the object, 
so no need to implement `flow-storm.runtime.values/snapshot-value`
====

== Dealing with too many traces

If you are tracing some code that ends up in a infinite loop the debugger will probably choke on
too many traces, making everything slow and where your only option is to restart it.

For preventing this _FlowStorm_ provides a couple of tools :

*If you are using vanilla FlowStorm* there is `:thread-trace-limit`, you can use it like this :

[,clojure]
----
#rtrace ^{:thread-trace-limit 200} ;; set our fuse at 200
(loop [i 0]
  (if (> i 100)
    42 ;; we will never reach here
    (recur i)))
----

the infinite loop will be cut after 200 iterations by a thread-trace-limit exceeded exception, and you will have the traces on
the debugger to figure out what went wrong.

== Controlling instrumentation

If you are using _ClojureStorm_ or _ClojureScriptStorm_ it is important to learn how to control what gets instrumented and
how to uninstrument things.

The first important thing is to setup your instrumentation correctly via JVM properties :

On _ClojureStorm_ :

[,clojure]
----
-Dclojure.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=my-app,my-lib
-Dclojure.storm.instrumentSkipPrefixes=my-app.too-heavy,my-lib.uninteresting
-Dclojure.storm.instrumentSkipRegex=.*test.*
----

On _ClojureScriptStorm_ :

[,clojure]
----
-Dcljs.storm.instrumentOnlyPrefixes=my-app,my-lib
-Dcljs.storm.instrumentSkipPrefixes=my-app.too-heavy,my-lib.uninteresting
----

Apart from `instrumentOnlyPrefixes` which you probably already know, there is `instrumentSkipPrefixes` which also
accepts a comma separated list of namespaces prefixes to skip, and instrumentSkipRegex with accepts a regex for
namespaces to skip. All these together allows you to instrument you whole app but some undesired namespaces.

The next important thing is to be able to enable/disable instrumentation and add/remove prefixes without restarting the
repl. This is slightly different between Clojure and ClojureScript.

=== Controlling instrumentation in ClojureStorm

You can disable/enable instrumentation by evaluating the keys`:noinst` and  `:inst` on your repl.
Disabling/enabling instrumentation will not reload your code, so if you need to re-evaluate the forms you are interested
in after enabling/disabling instrumentation.

For adding/removing and check your prefixes without restarting your repl you can call :

[,clojure]
----
(clojure.storm.Emitter/addInstrumentationOnlyPrefix "dev")
(clojure.storm.Emitter/removeInstrumentationOnlyPrefix "dev")

(clojure.storm.Emitter/addInstrumentationSkipPrefix "dev")
(clojure.storm.Emitter/removeInstrumentationSkipPrefix "dev")

(clojure.storm.Emitter/getInstrumentationOnlyPrefixes)
(clojure.storm.Emitter/getInstrumentationSkipPrefixes)
----

You can also check your current prefixes by evaluating the `:help` keyword at the repl.

=== Controlling instrumentation in ClojureScriptStorm 

You can add,remove and check your prefixes and also enable/disable instrumentation in ClojureScript with your Clojure
repl (not the Cljs one) by calling :

[,clojure]
----
(cljs.storm.api/add-instr-only-prefix "dev")
(cljs.storm.api/rm-instr-only-prefix "dev")

(cljs.storm.api/add-instr-skip-prefix "dev")
(cljs.storm.api/rm-instr-skip-prefix "dev")

(cljs.storm.api/get-instr-prefixes)
(cljs.storm.api/set-instrumentation true)
----

The `[add|rm]-instr-prefix` set of functions have an extra parameter called `touch-path`.
This is kind of a hacky way of going around shadow-cljs cache.

Lets say you added/removed a prefix and you want to fire a shadow-cljs recompile of your files so the changes take effect.
Shadow-cljs will not recompile files that haven't been modified since the last compilation. You can use the `touch-path`
parameter for this. If you provide `src` for example, it will walk the directory structure down and touch every file,
which should fire a recompilation.

== Styling and theming

All functions that start the debugger ui (`flow-storm.api/local-connect`, `flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger`) accept a map
with the `:styles`, `:title` and `:theme` keywords. If `:styles` points to a css file it will be used to overwrite the default styles, in case you 
want to change colors, make your fonts bigger, etc. `:theme` could be one of `:auto` (default), `:light`, `:dark`. Title can be used to
distinguish between multiple debugger instances.

Like this :

[,clojure]
----
user> (local-connect {:styles "~/.flow-storm/big-fonts.css", :theme :dark, :title "FlowStormMainDebugger"})
----

If you are using _ClojureStorm_ you can also provide them with :

   -Dflowstorm.title=FlowStormMainDebugger
   -Dflowstorm.theme=dark
   -Dflowstorm.styles=~/.flow-storm/big-fonts.css
   
You can overwrite all the styles defined here https://github.com/flow-storm/flow-storm-debugger/blob/master/resources/styles.css

== Key bindings

=== General

- `Ctrl-g` Cancel any long running task (only search supported yet)
- `Ctrl-l` Clean all debugger state
- `Ctrl-d` Toggle debug-mode. Will log useful debugging information to the console
- `Ctrl-u` Unblock all breakpoint blocked threads if any
- `Ctrl-t` Rotate themes
- `Ctrl-plus` Increment font size
- `Ctrl-minus` Decrement font size
- `F`      "Select the Flows tool"
- `B`      "Select the Browser tool"
- `T`      "Select the Taps tool"
- `D`      "Select the Docs tool"

=== Flows

- `Esc` Select the funnel default flow threads list
- `0` Select flow id 0 threads list
- `t` Select the tree tool (needs to be inside a thread)
- `c` Select the code tool (needs to be inside a thread)
- `f` Select the functions tool (needs to be inside a thread)

- `P` Step prev over. Go to previous step on the same frame
- `p` Step prev
- `n` Step next
- `N` Step next over. Go to next step on the same frame
- `^` Step out
- `<` Step first
- `>` Step last
- `Ctrl-f` Copy current function symbol
- `Ctrl-Shift-f` Copy current function call form
- `Ctrl-z` Undo navigation
- `Ctrl-r` Redo navigation

== Debugging react native applications

Debugging ClojureScript react native application needs a combination of ClojureScript and remote debugging.

Assuming you are using shadow-cljs, have added the `flow-storm-inst` dependency, and that it started a nrepl server on port 9000, you 
can start a debugger and connect to it by running :

[,bash]
----
clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}' -X flow-storm.debugger.main/start-debugger :port 9000 :repl-type :shadow :build-id :your-app-build-id :debugger-host '"YOUR_DEV_MACHINE_IP"'
----

You also need to make it possible for the device to connect back to the debugger on port 7722. You can accomplish this by running :

[,bash]
----
adb reverse tcp:7722 tcp:7722
----

Also remember that you need to have installed the `websocket` npm library. You can do this like :

[,bash]
----
npm install websocket --save
----

== Working on Windows with WSL2

For those using WSL2 on Windows. You'll need to set up an X-Server on Windows, make sure you drill a hole in the firewall for the port, and then specify the display for the WSL process.

Then everything should work. The steps are:

    . Install VcXsrv on Windows.
    . Run the XLaunch app on Windows, Choose Multiple Windows, Display Number 0, Start no client, Check all settings on the Extra Settings screen (specifically "Disable access control"
    . In the WSL2 terminal, run ip addr | grep eth0 to determine the ip of the xserver
    . On Windows, go to Firewall and network protection, select Advanced Settings, and add a new Inbound Rule in the Windows Defender window that pops up.
    . For the rule, select Port, then TCP, specific port 6000, then click next twice, and finally name the rule something appropriate, like "XServer rule".
    . Now find the rule you just created, right click, select Properties, then the Scope tab, and enter the IP address you found at step 3 with an appropriate range in order to allow the port through for the WSL2 subsystem.
    . Now find the ip address of your windows machine by typing ipconfig in a windows terminal
    . Now, in the WSL2 terminal, type export DISPLAY=IP_ADDERSS_FOUND_ON_STEP_7:0.0
    . Also in the WSL2 terminal, type export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
    . Now you can start clojure with the command clj -Sforce -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-dbg {:mvn/version "RELEASE"} com.github.flow-storm/flow-storm-inst {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}'
    . That should get you into the REPL, where you should type (require '[flow-storm.api :as fs-api])
    . Finally, type (fs-api/local-connect) and you're done!

== Troubleshooting

=== Instrument verbose

By default functions like `flow-storm.api/instrument-namespaces-clj` will not print warnings on the console. You can log extra information
by providing `:verbose? true` to the options map.

=== Run verbose

`#rtrace form` just expands to `(flow-storm.api/runi {} form)`.

The first argument is a options map, which accepts `:verbose? :true`, in which case _FlowStorm_ will print to the console tracing stats.

Is useful when you have instrumented a big application and wish to see tracing progress while running.

=== Run with JDK 11

FlowStorm UI requires JDK >= 17. If you can't upgrade your JDK you can still use it by downgrading JavaFx.

If that is the case add this dependencies to your alias :

[,clojure]
----
org.openjfx/javafx-controls {:mvn/version "19.0.2"}
org.openjfx/javafx-base     {:mvn/version "19.0.2"}
